django-downloads
===================

I have a need of access controlled downloads. ie: you must be authenticated
to the site, and given specific download permissions via being a certain
user or in a certain group to be able to download some files. This made
it necessary to do the access control checking inside of django and with the
advent of Django 1.2 and apps like django-guardian we have an interface
that gives us per-object level access controls.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.
