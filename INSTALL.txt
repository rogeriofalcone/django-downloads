To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Note that this application requires Python 2.4 or later, and Django
1.2 or greater. If you have django-guardian installed it will use that
to allow per-object level ACL's which is part of the whole point.
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django
from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
